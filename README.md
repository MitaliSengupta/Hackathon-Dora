# Trusty, the peer AI for DoraHacks Hackathon
#### Student project to integrate AI and Blockchain
## Contributers:
- [Sidney Burkett](https://github.com/sidneyriffic) -- **AI & algorithm design expert & programmer**

- [Austin Harshberger](https://github.com/aharshbe) -- **Programmer of AI algorithm and blockchain**

- [Kevin Yook](https://github.com/yook00627) -- **Implementation of AI**

- [Andrew Suh](https://github.com/Donnerschlag) -- **Blockchain implementor and programmer**

- [Becky Chen](https://github.com/bchen528) -- **Programmer & marketing expert**

### CONTRAINTS:
    Must be on Python version 3.6+

### Assumptions:
    * The teacher is entering scores, students are entereing PLD votes after PLD completes
    * All users have exercise averages that can be entered to seed the data
    * Voting anonimity is important and maintained

STEPS FOR AI

1. Randomly going through and eliminating non-zeroes.
2. Choose preference metrics.
3. Look at previous PLD average (Quant.)
4. Run captain's log algo (Quali.)
5. Run shitty rank alg (Quali.)
6. Compare exercises scores with 3,4 and 5 (Quan.)
7. Compare steps 5 and 6 (Weigh higher)
8. Take votes average - ?
9. Print results.
10. Verify AI target VS AI Error.
11a. Run memory store evaluation (How did the AI do?)
11b. If didn't do well choose new combination (Median PLD?)
12a. Ask for input of PLD votes.
12b. Store PLD run time (How long it takes?)
13. Produce 'one on one' pairs --->
---> 14. Take 'one on one' average ---->
---> 15. Return Pairs
16. Return Target of AI (T/F) ---> median PLD?
